Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. 
The name was derived from an old BBC television comedy called Monty Python's Flying Circus.
One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person's work. 
New languages are usually developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals.
Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. 
The speed with which Python has spread is a result of the work of thousands programmers, testers and users.
Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation, a non-profit membership organization and a community.
They are devoted to developing, improving, expanding, and popularizing the Python language.
